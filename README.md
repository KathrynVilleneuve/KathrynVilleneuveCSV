Kathryn Villeneuve
==================

 I have worked in art related fields for over 20 years with a concentration on painting. 
 I began a career  in the film Industry in 1996, then in 1997 was hired by Disney Imagineering 
 to take part in the highly regarded and fascinating project of Tokyo Disney. I worked on this and other projects, 
 staying at Imagineering for six years. Subsequently, I decided to return as a set painter and scenic and have 
 made a successful career in film and television for the past 10 years.
